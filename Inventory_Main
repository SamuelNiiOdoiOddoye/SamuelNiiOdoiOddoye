    You must now write a computer programme which will be able to allow the store to manage all aspects of their stock.
     This includes entering new stock, allocating existing stock and the ability to run reports based on these elements.  

    You must 
    Identify a problem to solve for the store, using a computer programme
    Develop a computer programme using an appropriate Object Orientated Programming language (OOP) that can be used by the retail store to solve the problem
    Ensure all code within the programme is explained using comments
